# Python Notebook to Interactive HTML Report
### Generate a Single-File, Shareable HTML Report from Your Python Data Analysis Notebook

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Python-based approach to converting your data analysis Jupyter Notebook into a self-contained, interactive HTML report.  The notebook itself contains the code to:

1.  Perform data analysis using Python (in this example, with Pandas).
2.  Generate visualizations using Plotly.
3.  Embed both the code, the resulting charts, and any textual interpretations into a single HTML file.

This simplifies the process of sharing your work with others, as they can view the complete analysis, including interactive visualizations, in any web browser without needing a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Features

* **Notebook-Driven Conversion:** The conversion process is handled within the Jupyter Notebook itself.
* **Pandas and Plotly Integration:** Uses Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly for interactive chart generation.
* **Automatic HTML Output:** Generates a single HTML file containing:
    * The original Python code.
    * Interactive Plotly charts.
    * Any Markdown text (interpretations, explanations) from your notebook.
* **Shareable Output:** The resulting HTML file can be easily shared via email, web hosting, or other methods.

## Example Usage

1.  **Run the Notebook:** Execute the provided Jupyter Notebook.  It contains the Python code to:
    * Create a sample Pandas DataFrame.
    * Generate a bar chart and a pie chart using Plotly.
    * Construct an HTML file that includes the code, charts, and interpretations.
2.  **Locate the Output:** After the notebook has finished running, find the generated `startup_analysis_web.html` file in the same directory as the notebook.
3.  **Open and Share:** Open `startup_analysis_web.html` in any web browser to view the interactive report.  Share this HTML file with others.

## Code Structure (Within the Notebook)

The notebook contains the following key code elements:

* **Import Libraries:**
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import plotly.express as px
    import plotly.io as pio
    ```
* **Data Definition:** A Pandas DataFrame (`df`) is created with sample startup data.
* **Chart Generation:**
    * A bar chart (`bar_fig`) showing "Revenue by Startup" is created.
    * A pie chart (`pie_fig`) showing "Sector Distribution" is created.
* **HTML Generation:**
    * The `pio.to_html()` function is used to convert the Plotly charts into HTML.
    * An HTML template is constructed as a string, incorporating the code and chart HTML.
    * The complete HTML is written to the `startup_analysis_web.html` file.

## Requirements

* Jupyter Notebook
* Python
* Pandas
* Plotly

## Output Example

The generated HTML report will contain:

* A section displaying the Python code used to create the charts.
* An interactive bar chart showing revenue for each startup.
* An interactive pie chart showing the distribution of startups across sectors.
* Textual interpretations of the charts, embedded within the report.
